# Game Name

## High concept

Hit the beats and tap to the rhythm! Can you keep up with the music and get a high score?

## Genre

* Music
* Rhythm

## Platform

It would be available on pc, mobile and tablet devices.

## Esthetics

Graphics would be simple and abstract. It has to be simple so players can see what is going on on screen. And the elements of gameplay will be abstract, and reflect the mood, tempo, and theme of the music.

## Gameplay
### Mechanics

* Achievement
* Pride
* Status
* Modifiers
* Micro leader-boards
* Envy
* Endless

These would be the items that drive players to keep playing and strive for a highest score on the leaderboard. They would feel a sense of achievement and pride when they beat the high score of their own or someone else's. In doing so they are motivated to reach a higher status, in terms of their score, and possibly out of envy of others' scores. Modifiers are also activated when players don't miss beats and helps them get even more points to achieve the above. Players can also play it an endless amount of times just to get a better score.

### Controls

PC: Keyboard for playing, mouse for navigation  
Mobile and tablet devices: Touch screen

### New User Experience

There will be a tutorial level that will walk through new players with the mechanics and controls. A pop up will appear asking if the player wants to play the tutorial when the player visited the site for the first time. If the player skips the tutorial, they can come back and play the tutorial again if they wanted to.

### Player Learning

For players to get the highest score of a level as possible, they basically have to be as accurate as possible with the beats. In detail, they have to hit the beats when the center of the beat is as close to the center of the receptor as possible. There is a score multiplier that will activate when players didn't miss any beats in a certain amount of time, and will not stop until a player misses another beat during the multiplier time. So players can get a way higher score if they didn't miss a single beat since the score multiplier mode will be activated very soon and last throughout the whole rest of the song.
